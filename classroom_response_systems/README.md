# Classroom Response Systems

## Learning Outcomes:

By the end of instruction, learners will be able to:

- describe how to use the following platform as Classroom Response Systems (CRS)
    - Google Forms
    - Socrative
    - Mentimeter
- create an account on the three platforms
- develop questionnaires and visualize responses on the three platforms

## What is a Classroom Response System (CRS)?
A CRS is a pedagogical tool that a teacher may use to promote active learning and increase student learning. It should be integrated with other learning strategies and, if used effectively, it can have a dramatic impact on the classroom. 
Originally, CRS, often referred to as "clickers", consist of three elements: a receiver, which accepts responses from learners, a transmmitter or clicker (a small device), which sends the responses, and a software to store and manage the data.

In this tutorial, we will see how to use three platforms - Google Forms, Socrative, and Mentimeter - as CRS.
It is worth noting that the technical aspects, namely how to develop questionnaires in Google Forms or using Socrative and Mentimeter, are only part of the story: in order to use such systems to transform the classroom into an acrive learning environment, you will have to learn how and when to use them for formative assessments. To this aim, it is essential to know what is formative assessment and how to perform it.
